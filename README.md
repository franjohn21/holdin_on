# Three Audio

> A 3d sound visualizer. 

Currently under construction but basic MVP is up. I got the inspiration from the awesome website [georgeandjonathan.com](http://www.georgeandjonathan.com/). I wanted to learn more about using Three.js so I used this app as an opportunity for that. It's not too complicated yet -- it currently just moves an object based on the volume of the song. 

**Note:** It probably won't work outside of Chrome.

#### Technologies:
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* AJAX
* Three.js
* Tween.js
* HTML
* CSS
* Consumes Soundcloud.info API
